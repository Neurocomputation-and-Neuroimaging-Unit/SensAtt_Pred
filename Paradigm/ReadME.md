# Paradigm
## Matlab
First run the "CreateExperimentTrials" script in Matlab [link]. The script will require just to input the correct participant ID and then it will automatically create the folder structure for the experiment. 

The first time the script runs, it will print the path of the training trials file (found here). Please change the training file path so that it matches the location in your machine. 
The printed path needs to be copy-pasted in Unity. 

The second time the script runs, it will generate sequences of trials for a whole (and unique) experimental session. For details on the sequences, please consult the associated paper [link]. 

## Unity
Simply download the folder named "Unity" and add it as a project in your Unity Hub app. Once opened, it will probably take a while to load. When prompted to set some variables while loading, just click "no". 
Once in the Unity interface, make sure that you have at least two "Game" windows. One window will have the same field of view as the one projected into the Oculus headset. In the other window you will need to set up the correct path and variables for running the experiment.
